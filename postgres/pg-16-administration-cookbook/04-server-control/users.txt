# PgBouncer also supports SCRAM (Salt Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism)
# authentication. If the PgBouncer to server connection requires SCRAM authentication, then you must also 
# connect from the client to PgBouncer using SCRAM authentication. To use that effectively, you need to copy 
# the SCRAM secrets from the database server into the users.txt file.

# You may wish to create the users.txt file by directly copying the details from the server.
# This can be done by using the following psql script (this is the same one that was used
# for md5 authentication, back when that was recommended):
# postgres=> \o users.txt
# postgres=> \t
# postgres=> SELECT '"'||rolname||'" "'||rolpassword||'"'
# postgres-> FROM pg_authid;
# postgres=> \q
