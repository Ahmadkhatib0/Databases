-- We want to issue regular commits as we go. The preceding procedure is coded so that it issues

-- break it down into smaller pieces, whether it is the number of rows scanned or rows updated.

-- a simple job restart mechanism. This uses a persistent table

-- Execute the preceding procedure like this:
