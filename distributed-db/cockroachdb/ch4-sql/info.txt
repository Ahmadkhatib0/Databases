-- DROP CASCADE and Foreign Keys
   DROP TABLE...CASCADE will drop any foreign key constraints that reference the table but
   will not drop the tables or rows that contain those foreign keys. The end result will be
   “dangling” references in these tables.
   Because of this incompleteness, and because it can be hard to be certain exactly what
   CASCADE will do, it’s usually better to manually remove all dependencies on a table
   before dropping it.

-- The ->> and @> operators can have different performance characteristics. In particular, 
   ->> might exploit an inverted index where @> would use a table scan.
   We can interrogate the structure of the JSON document using the jsonb_each and
   jsonb_object_keys functions. jsonb_each returns one row per attribute in the JSON
   document, while jsonb_object_keys returns just the attribute keys. This is useful if
   you don’t know what is stored inside the JSONB column.


If you think of a view as a stored query, then a
  materialized view can be thought of as a stored result

The ON CONFLICT clause allows you to control what happens if an INSERT violates a uniqueness 
  constraint Without an ON CONFLICT clause, a uniqueness constraint violation will cause 
  the entire INSERT statement to abort. DO NOTHING allows the INSERT statement as a whole 
  to succeed but ignores any inserts that violate the uniqueness clause. The DO UPDATE clause
  allows you to specify an UPDATE statement that executes instead of the INSERT. The DO
  UPDATE functionality is similar in functionality to the UPSERT statement 


-- IMPORT/IMPORT INTO
-- The IMPORT statement imports the following types of data into CockroachDB:
-- • Avro
-- • Comma Separated Values (CSV)/Tab Separated Values (TSV)
-- • Postgres dump files
-- • MySQL dump files
-- • CockroachDB dump files
-- IMPORT creates a new table, while IMPORT INTO allows an import into an existing table.
-- The files to be imported should exist either in a cloud storage bucket—Google Cloud
-- Storage, Amazon S3, or Azure Blob storage—from an HTTP address or from the
-- local filesystem (“nodelocal”).


Transaction: 

PRIORITY sets the transaction priority. In the event of a conflict, 
  HIGH priority transactions are less likely to be retried.

AS OF SYSTEM TIME allows a READ ONLY transaction to view data from a snapshot of 
  database history.. The AS OF SYSTEM TIME clause can be applied to SELECT and 
  BEGIN TRANSACTION statements as well as in BACKUP and RESTORE operations. 
  AS OF SYSTEM TIME specifies that a SELECT statement or all the statements in a 
  READ ONLY transaction should execute on a snapshot of the database at that system time. 
  These snapshots are made available by the MVCC architecture 
  

SAVEPOINT creates a named rollback point that can be used as the target of a ROLLBACK
  statement. This allows a portion of a transaction to be discarded without discarding
  all of the transaction’s work,

The following example, the insert of the misspelled number tree is
  rolled back and corrected without abandoning the transaction as a whole:
BEGIN ;
INSERT INTO numbers VALUES(1,'one');
INSERT INTO numbers VALUES(2,'two');
SAVEPOINT two;
INSERT INTO numbers VALUES(3,'tree');
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT two;
INSERT INTO numbers VALUES(3,'three');
COMMIT;


SELECT FOR UPDATE
  The FOR UPDATE clause of a SELECT statement locks the rows returned by a query,
  ensuring that they cannot be modified by another transaction between the time they
  are read and when the transaction ends. This is typically used to implement the
  pessimistic locking pattern A FOR UPDATE query should be executed within a transaction. 
  Otherwise, the locks are released on completion of the SELECT statement.
  A FOR UPDATE issued within a transaction will, by default, block other FOR UPDATE
  statements on the same rows or other transactions that seek to update those rows
  from completing until a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is issued. However, if a higher-priority
  transaction attempts to update the rows or attempts to issue a FOR UPDATE, then the
  lower-priority transaction will be aborted and will need to retry.
