////////////////////////////////////// SORTED SETS /////////////////////////// 
// in sorted sets key called a MEMBER and value called a SCORE,, 
// the structure to work with sorted sets is like e.g : ZADD setsName score member    // so the value first not the key
// score can only be number

ZINCRBY products 44  or -44 keyboard                   //update a member, 
ZRANGE products 5 9  [WITHSCROES]                      //get members between tow indexes

//LIMIT is usually Used with BYSCORE , for example for pagination purposes 






/////////////////////////////// THE SORT COMMAND ///////////////////////////////////////
the sort command  operate operate on the members when sorting sorted list, rather than the score ; 
SORT books:likes ALPHA 
SORT books:likes LIMIT 1 2 ALPHA                 
SORT books:likes BY books:*->year                          // sort books:likes SET by the year member in the SORTED SET called books
//how the last command works? each member from the books:likes will be placed in place of the * , and in each loop it will for example like 
//books:complete-history and look on the member that called year (->year) and extract it, repeat the loop , and sort them based on the BY  
SORT books:likes BY books:*->year GET books:*->title         //like the previous steps, while here its like joining another set 
// so sort books:likes BY book's year member , and return only the title member from books set 
SORT books:likes BY books:*->year GET books:*->title  GET books:*->year  // unlimited GETs 
SORT books:likes BY books:*->year GET # GET books:*->title               //# to include the sorting criteria member in the return 
SORT books:likes BY nosort GET books:*->title                            //just a join, a good idea because already a sorted list  
SORT books:likes BY asdfasdfasdfasdf  DESC GET books:*->title            //like the nosort option, because this key does not exist
